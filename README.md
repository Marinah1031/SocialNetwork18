## Description

This project aims to establish a robust backend using Mongoose for a social media platform. Our primary goal is to harness the capabilities of Mongoose while also broadening our understanding of complementary technologies. We aspire to create a welcoming space where users can freely express their thoughts, engage in meaningful discussions, and share reactions with like-minded individuals. This platform is envisioned as a hub for lively and thought-provoking conversations, fostering a sense of community among its users

## Installation

- Install Mongo DB and Mongoose
- Install Insomnia or some other application to view the API routes
- Run *npm install*
- Run *npm start*


## Usage

- For both '/users' and '/thoughts', we have 'GET' and 'POST' requests that operate on the root of these models, allowing users to retrieve and create data.

- To interact with individual entities, such as a specific user or thought, we have 'GET', 'PUT', and 'DELETE' requests that include an ID in the route, like '/users/:userId' and '/thoughts/:thoughtId'. This structure enables actions like viewing, updating, and deleting specific user profiles or thoughts.

- To facilitate connections between users, we've implemented the concept of 'friends lists'. Users can manage their friends list to follow content by sending requests to '/api/users/:userId/friends/:friendId'. This allows users to establish relationships and follow updates from specific friends.

- Similar to the friends feature, we've also incorporated a system for thoughts and their reactions. Users can interact with thoughts and reactions by utilizing routes like '/api/thoughts/:thoughtId/reactions'. This setup enables users to express their thoughts and reactions to posts within the platform.
